## Usage Questions

### Which search method should I use?

**Hash Search** (üéØ):
- **Use for**: Local video files
- **Pros**: Exact synchronization matches

**Name Search** (üîç):

- **Pros**: Works with any content
- **Cons**: May require manual title adjustment

The extension automatically falls back from hash to name search when appropriate.

### Why do I get "No results found"?

**For Hash Search:**
- File must be local (not streaming)
- File must be accessible and not corrupted
- Subtitle may not exist for that specific file

**For Name Search:**
- Check title spelling and formatting
- Add year for movies, season/episode for TV shows
- Try different language selections
- Verify subtitle exists on OpenSubtitles.com

### How do I select multiple languages?

1. Open the extension interface
2. Use the three language dropdown menus:
   - "1. Subtitles Language" - Primary preference

   - "3. Subtitles Language" - Third preference
3. Results will be grouped by your language priorities

### Why don't subtitles load automatically?

Common causes:
1. **Wrong directory** - Subtitle must be in same folder as video
2. **Filename mismatch** - Subtitle name must match video name
3. **VLC settings** - Check Tools ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Subtitles/OSD
4. **Download behavior** - Set to "Load and save" in configuration
