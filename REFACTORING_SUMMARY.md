# Server.js Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Redundant Code Removal**
- Removed duplicate UI-related endpoints from `server.js`
- Moved all UI API endpoints to `ui-api.js` for better organization
- Eliminated duplicate performance monitoring code

### 2. **Simplified Stream Handler**
- Removed older Real-Debrid search fallback logic
- Streamlined to use only the MediaFusion architecture via `streamingProviderManager`
- Removed dependency on deprecated `generateRealDebridStreams` and `generateSampleRealDebridStreams`
- Simplified the flow to rely solely on `streamingManager` for stream generation

### 3. **Proper Initialization**
- Added proper initialization of `streamingProviderManager` with configuration
- Imported `streamingManager` directly from the module
- Ensured streaming providers are initialized before use

### 4. **Code Organization**
- Moved all UI-related endpoints to `ui-api.js`:
  - `/api/health` - Enhanced health monitoring
  - `/api/providers/status` - Provider cache statistics
  - `/api/providers/health` - Provider health check
  - `/api/search/cached` - Search cached content
  - `/api/streams/enrich` - Stream enrichment service
  - `/api/health/alldebrid` - AllDebrid health check
  - `/api/alldebrid/status` - AllDebrid status
  - `/api/performance/metrics` - Performance metrics
  - `/api/environment/status` - Environment status
  - `/api/config` - Enhanced configuration
  - `/api/settings` - Settings management
  - Dashboard endpoints

### 5. **Enhanced Imports**
- Added missing cache functions to `subtitleMatcher.js`:
  - `getCachedSubtitleContent`
  - `getProgressiveSubtitleContent`
  - `getAiEnhancementStatus`
- Updated imports in `server.js` to include these functions

### 6. **Focus on Core Functionality**
- `server.js` now focuses purely on:
  - Stremio addon handlers (subtitles, stream, manifest)
  - Core subtitle processing endpoints
  - Basic health check for compatibility
  - Security and input validation middleware

## Benefits

### 1. **Cleaner Architecture**
- Clear separation of concerns
- UI API endpoints consolidated in one place
- Core addon functionality isolated in `server.js`

### 2. **Simplified Stream Logic**
- Single source of truth for stream generation
- Consistent MediaFusion architecture usage
- Removed confusing fallback paths

### 3. **Better Maintainability**
- Easier to locate and modify UI-related endpoints
- Reduced code duplication
- Clear dependency structure

### 4. **Improved Performance**
- Eliminated redundant performance monitoring
- Streamlined stream generation process
- Better resource management

## Files Modified

1. **`server.js`** - Refactored to focus on core addon functionality
2. **`ui-api.js`** - Enhanced with all UI-related endpoints
3. **`lib/subtitleMatcher.js`** - Added missing cache functions

## MediaFusion Architecture Integration

The refactored code now properly uses the MediaFusion architecture:
- Single `streamingManager` instance for all stream operations
- Proper initialization with Real-Debrid and AllDebrid configurations
- Consistent error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced stream enrichment capabilities

## Testing

Both `server.js` and `ui-api.js` have been syntax-validated and are ready for deployment.
