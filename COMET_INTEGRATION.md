# Comet Integration - Multi-Debrid Support Implementation

## Overview

This implementation integrates patterns from the Comet addon to provide comprehensive multi-debrid provider support, specifically Real-Debrid and AllDebrid, with enhanced streaming capabilities and UI integration.

## Key Comet Patterns Implemented

### 1. Multi-Provider Architecture
- **Provider Management**: Centralized provider registration and management
- **Fallback Support**: Automatic fallback between providers when one fails
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health checking for all providers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with provider disabling

### 2. Debrid Service Integration
- **Real-Debrid Client**: Enhanced client with MediaFusion patterns
- **AllDebrid Client**: New client implementation based on Comet patterns
- **Unified API**: Common interface for all debrid services
- **Cache Availability**: Instant availability checking for cached content

### 3. Streaming Provider Manager
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Handles multiple debrid services simultaneously
- **Priority System**: Configurable provider priority for fallback
- **Connection Management**: Persistent connections and session management
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting and timeout handling

## API Endpoints

### Health Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Overall system health including both providers
- `GET /api/health/realdebrid` - Real-Debrid specific health check
- `GET /api/health/alldebrid` - AllDebrid specific health check

### Provider Status
- `GET /api/providers/status` - All providers status and statistics
- `GET /api/realdebrid/status` - Real-Debrid account and connection status
- `GET /api/alldebrid/status` - AllDebrid account and connection status

### Streaming Features
- `GET /api/search/cached?query=...` - Search cached content across all providers
- `POST /api/streams/enrich` - Enhance stream quality information
- `GET /api/streams/providers` - List available streaming providers

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Real-Debrid Configuration
REAL_DEBRID_API_KEY=your_real_debrid_api_key

# AllDebrid Configuration
ALL_DEBRID_API_KEY=your_all_debrid_api_key

# Common Settings
USER_IP=your_ip_address_for_debrid_services
```

### Provider Configuration
```javascript
const streamingConfig = {
    realdebrid: {
        apiKey: process.env.REAL_DEBRID_API_KEY,
        userIP: process.env.USER_IP || null
    },
    alldebrid: {
        apiKey: process.env.ALL_DEBRID_API_KEY,
        userIP: process.env.USER_IP || null
    }
};
```

## Provider Comparison

### Real-Debrid Features
- ✅ Instant torrent availability
- ✅ High-speed streaming
- ✅ Multiple file formats

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Premiumize integration
- [ ] TorBox support
- [ ] Debrid-Link integration
- [ ] Custom provider plugins
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Provider performance analytics

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Load balancing between providers
- [ ] Real-time provider performance monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Provider Authentication Failures**
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify account status
   - Test connection manually

2. **Timeout Issues**
   - Increase timeout values
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify provider server status

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement proper delays
   - Use connection pooling
   - Monitor request frequency

### Debug Tools
- Use `/api/health` for overall status
